# The Brief
* Terraform a load balanced web front end in AWS, GCP orAzure
* There should be a minimum of 2 instances and they need to be able to scale across availability zones.
* Ideally the web page should be secure.
* The Vpc should be appropriately split into the required subnets.
* The hosts should be running Linux and the choice of web server is down to the individual
* The use of modules
